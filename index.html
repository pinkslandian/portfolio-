         second year of college at Ferris State University. I am currently studying Computer Information Systems, and by inhancing 
         my studies I have put myself futher into my career by going into summer employement and internships that are in the field 
         I hope to join. I am a Detroit native, and a Midnight Golf Alumni. <a href="https://www.midnightgolf.org/"> Midnight Golf </a>
        is a program where they take the youth of Detroit and they prepare us for the real world by teaching life skills, college 
        readiness, the actual sport of golf, and many other beneficial things that will help us in the future. I spend a lot of my

        I can. </p>
