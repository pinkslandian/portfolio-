<p> Everyday I am still growing as a human being, intaking more information and adding new skills to my toolbox. 
Some of my skills include: Team Work, Communication, Time management, Self motivation, and Leadership. 
<br> 
<br>
<i> Team work:</i> I believe teamwork is the most essential skill one can have. I am very good at working with other people and adapting to new enviornments. 
<br>
<br>
<i> Communication: </i> Clear communication is always key in any situation. My communication skills are amazing. I always try to make sure everyone understands what is going on, and that everyone is cofortable. 
<br>
<br>
<i> Time Managment: </i> Time is something that we all need and is constantly slipping through our fingers. I like to spend my time very effeciantly so that I can get all my tasks done  in the appropiate amount of time. 
<br>
<br>
<i> Self Motivation: </i> The attitude that you have can and will effect the people that you are around. I strive to always have a positive mindset and attidue by keeping myself motivated and eager to complete my day. 
<br>
<br>
<i> Leadership: </i> Being a woman and wanting to go into a stem field inspires me to become a leader and influencer to my peers. By practicing my many other skills I would make an amazing leader. As James Humes said "The art of communication is the language of leadership."
