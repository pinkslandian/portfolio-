 <p> This is one of my first pieces I've ever worked on. Writing is a passion of mine and I figured why not combing my writing with a webpage. I've always wanted to publish my poetry, and this was a start. <a href="https://sirenisland.netlify.com/"> Here </a></p>
 <p> This piece was my second working. I taught myself html after being interested in conspiracy theories. After seeing so many twitter threads I figured why not recreate one onto webpage like a blog. I have never seen that before. <a href = "https://erratic-blog.netlify.com/"> Here </a>

 <p> This piece is a group project I helped work on with my internship at Journi. We were assigned to create a webpage about a local Detroit Public School. The specific page I worked on was the contact page. Oveall after all of the hard work and learning I put into this webpage I am very proud of myself for the progress I've made. I'm so excited to see myself grow as a woman in this world. I absolutely love coding and web design and being able to publish it really made me fall in love even more.   </p>  </div>
